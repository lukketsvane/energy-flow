# Energy Flow Application

The Energy Flow Application is a comprehensive tool designed to calculate, visualize, and optimize energy flow within factories or plants. Developed using Next.js, Tailwind CSS for styling, and deployed on Vercel, it allows users to generate scenarios based on various energy sources and evaluate their impacts.

## Features

- **Calculation and visualization**: Enables users to see the process and energy flow in a detailed graphical format.
- **Scenario creation**: Allows users to generate scenarios based on different energy sources and energy recovery solutions.
- **Reports**: Auto-generated reports on energy flow scenarios.
